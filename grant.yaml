# Feedback from Nuffield (Nov 28, 2025)

  summary: |
    Outline was "smorgasbord of activities without sufficiently clear strategic thread".
    Requested restructured approach with fewer committed activities and more flexibility.
  key_points:
    - Small number of specific committed activities (council tax integration suggested)
    - Annual substantive output (e.g., autumn budget analysis)
    - Flexible development activities with indicative list
    - Optional core operation costs
    - Diversify funding sources
    - Organizational development (governance, management, staff)
