{"id":"nuffield-rda-2025-jlz","title":"Prepare Nuffield full application responding to feedback","description":"## Deadline\n**January 14, 2026** (full application)\nProject start date: July 1, 2026\n\n## Reference\nFR-000027022\n\n## Verbatim Feedback from Anvar Sarygulov (Nov 28, 2025)\n\n\u003e We have been impressed by the dynamism and hard work of the team given what you have managed to accomplish within the short time frame of our first grant. However, we think the outline proposal you have submitted is a smorgasbord of activities without a sufficiently clear strategic or motivational thread behind them, and we are concerned that you are seeking to commit to a programme of activities to fit with our processes before you are fully ready to do so. The current plan would also not give you sufficient flexibility to respond to events or opportunities. We would therefore like to propose a different approach to the full application, which we propose to contain:\n\u003e\n\u003e - A commitment to a small number of specific activities or outputs: we see potential in your plans for council tax integration but we are not directive on this. We also request that you consider proposing some form of substantive annual output e.g. an analysis of the autumn budget.\n\u003e - A proposal for development activities that offer you flexibility to prioritise on the basis of future events and opportunities. You should include an indicative list of potential activities, alongside a comment on how you would approach prioritisation. If there are development activities you consider to be essential to commit to at this point in time, you should make a clear case for this, but otherwise we would keep this programme of activities under review with you as the grant proceeded.\n\u003e - If valuable and necessary, you may also include some activities and costs for core operation of PolicyEngine UK, distinct from substantive upgrades to capabilities on back-end or front-end, and detail and how the Foundations funding would contribute to this.\n\u003e\n\u003e We would consider a total funding envelope of up to £100k per year or £300k or less at the full application stage given the level of competition for our funds.\n\u003e\n\u003e We would like to be clear that our suggested approach above, or something similar to it, offers what we see as the best chance of obtaining continuing Nuffield Foundation funding. However, this does not constitute a guarantee that the proposal will be successful. It will still need to be considered on its own merits and alongside other full applications being invited in this round, not all of which we have the budget to support.\n\u003e\n\u003e In addition, we would welcome the full application to offer some thinking on further diversifying funding sources for the UK operation during the grant. We would also like a comment on how you will further develop PolicyEngine organisationally, including in terms of governance and management and development of your staff.\n\n## Key Changes Required\n\n### Budget\n- Reduce from £380k to £300k max (£100k/year)\n\n### Structure (per Nuffield guidance)\n1. **Small number of committed activities**\n   - Council tax integration (they mentioned this positively)\n   - Annual substantive output (e.g., Autumn Budget analysis)\n\n2. **Flexible development activities**\n   - Indicative list of potential activities\n   - Prioritisation approach explanation\n   - Keep under review during grant\n\n3. **Core operations (optional)**\n   - If needed, separate from capability upgrades\n   - Explain how Nuffield funding contributes\n\n### Additional Required Content\n- Diversifying funding sources strategy\n- Organizational development plan (governance, management, staff development)\n\n## Action Items\n- [ ] Restructure proposal around fewer committed deliverables\n- [ ] Create indicative list of flexible activities with prioritisation criteria\n- [ ] Revise budget to £300k\n- [ ] Add funding diversification section\n- [ ] Add organizational development section\n- [ ] Review Guide for Applicants for full application requirements","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-12-18T21:29:36.662585-08:00","updated_at":"2025-12-18T21:29:36.662585-08:00"}
