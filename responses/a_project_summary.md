PolicyEngine's open-source microsimulation model enables tax and benefit policy analysis at household, local, and national levels. Following successful elite adoption—including an HM Treasury pilot and use by major think tanks—this three-year project enhances the model's capacity to provide evidence on the UK's most critical policy issues. We will expand coverage with council tax modelling, integrate policy-critical datasets (e.g., OBR projections and DWP data), develop AI capabilities for natural language insights, and ensure rapid Budget response. Through targeted roundtables and research partnerships with expert stakeholders and local organisations, we ensure microsimulation evidence informs policy debates when decisions are made.
