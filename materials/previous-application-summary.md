## Executive Summary

PolicyEngine's free and open-source microsimulation model enables anyone to compute the impact of public policy, both at a personal and societal level. The project seeks to advance PolicyEngine's **comprehensiveness**, **accuracy**, and **accessibility** to ensure upcoming debates about childcare, public services, and other critical issues are well served by data and engage a broad community of stakeholders.

## Key Objectives

### 1. Comprehensiveness
- **Childcare subsidies**: Adding £6bn in annual childcare spending to the model
- **Public services**: Modeling two-thirds of public spending through ONS data integration
- **Local disaggregation**: Creating constituency and local authority-level analysis using MRP-style reweighting

### 2. Accuracy
- **Cross-model validation**: Building dashboard to compare PolicyEngine with UKMOD, ScottishTaxBenefitModel, and other models
- **Test-driven development**: Maintaining rigorous software quality standards
- **Transparent validation**: Public dashboard showing deviations from administrative data (<10% vs 40% for other models)

### 3. Accessibility
- **Beta testing infrastructure**: User login system for feedback and quality assurance
- **Comprehensive documentation**: Following UKMOD country report structure
- **UX enhancements**: User research, interface redesign, tooltips, inline documentation
- **AI integration**: Conversational interface using LLMs for natural language queries
- **Community growth**: Monthly trainings, workshops, inaugural user symposium

## Impact to Date (Pre-Award)

- **2,300 UK visitors** and **59,000 global visitors** in past 12 months
- Used by **NIESR** (Autumn Statement analysis featured in Times, FT, Telegraph)
- Adopted by **Centre for Policy Studies** (3 reports including one that became law)
- **HM Treasury** exploring PolicyEngine for enhanced data modeling

## Key Differentiators

**Why PolicyEngine is Unique:**
1. **Speed**: Minutes vs weeks for traditional microsimulation

## Relevance to New Application

**Build on Success:**
- Leverage completed infrastructure (local disaggregation, validation, documentation)
- Extend to new policy areas or analytical approaches
- Deepen existing capabilities
- Scale community engagement

**Avoid Duplication:**
- Don't re-propose childcare, public services, local modeling (already funded)
- Don't repeat UX research or AI integration (in progress)
- Focus on genuinely new capabilities or research questions

**Potential Next Steps:**
- Climate policy modeling (carbon tax, green transition impacts)
- Wealth taxation and inequality analysis
- Long-term fiscal sustainability analysis
- Integration with other government datasets
- International comparisons and policy learning
- Behavioral economics integration beyond labor supply
- Evaluation of actual policy reforms (ex-post analysis)
