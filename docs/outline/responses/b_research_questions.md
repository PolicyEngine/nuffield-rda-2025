<!-- What research questions will your project answer? -->

This project addresses three interconnected research questions about democratizing policy analysis:

**1. How can AI democratize access to elite-grade policy analysis tools while maintaining accuracy and trust?**

We will develop and evaluate AI-powered report authoring tools that translate natural language queries into rigorous microsimulation analysis. By measuring user comprehension, accuracy of AI-generated outputs, and trust levels across different stakeholder groups, we will establish best practices for responsible AI deployment in policy analysis.

**2. What is the impact of providing local policymakers and civil society with constituency-level microsimulation capabilities?**

Building on our Nuffield-funded local disaggregation work, we will assess how access to constituency-level analysis affects policy engagement by MPs, local media, and community organizations. We will track usage patterns, measure quality of policy discourse, and evaluate whether local granularity increases evidence-based decision-making.

**3. Can rapid-response evidence provision improve the quality and inclusivity of policy debates during critical moments?**

During Budget announcements and election periods, we will evaluate whether 48-hour policy analysis turnaround affects media coverage quality, parliamentary debate, and public understanding, comparing periods with and without rapid PolicyEngine analysis.
