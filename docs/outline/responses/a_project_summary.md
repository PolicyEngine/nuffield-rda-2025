PolicyEngine's free microsimulation model enables analysis of tax and benefit policies at household and national levels. Following successful elite adoption—including an HM Treasury pilot and integration with major think tanks—this project scales proven capabilities to civil society. Building on Nuffield-funded infrastructure (local disaggregation, AI pilot, training program), we will enhance accessibility through AI-powered report authoring, expand coverage with council tax modeling, and scale community engagement through training and partnerships. This enables local media, MPs, and civil society organizations to analyze any policy proposal with the same tools trusted by government, democratizing evidence-based policymaking.
