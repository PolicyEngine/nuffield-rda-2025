This project addresses a critical inflection point: elite institutions have validated PolicyEngine—HM Treasury published an official algorithmic transparency record of their pilot, and our estimates consistently align with the Institute for Fiscal Studies and Resolution Foundation—yet civil society lacks equivalent access to rigorous policy analysis.

The previous Nuffield grant built comprehensive infrastructure (650 parliamentary constituencies, childcare modeling, AI pilot, validation dashboards). This investment exceeded expectations: rather than serving only under-resourced think tanks, it attracted the UK's most powerful policy institutions. This success creates an unprecedented opportunity to democratize elite-grade analysis.

The project is distinctive in combining proven technical capacity with strategic timing. Budget cycles and election periods create natural experiments for evaluating rapid evidence provision. Our constituency-level data, developed with Nuffield support, enables at-scale partnerships with local media and MPs that were previously impossible.

This directly addresses Nuffield priorities: building trustworthy institutions through evidence democratization (Priority 5), ensuring AI technology benefits all stakeholders not just elites (Priority 3), and advancing prosperity through more informed, inclusive policy debates (Priorities 1 and 2). The research capitalizes on substantial previous investment while addressing new questions about scaling technical tools to democratic participation.
