Our three-year project comprises interconnected workstreams building on previous Nuffield-funded infrastructure while addressing scaling challenges identified through elite adoption.

WORKSTREAM 1: AI-POWERED ACCESSIBILITY AND DATA INTEGRATION

Multi-Surface AI Integration

Our current grant launches natural language microsimulation insights and policy interaction explanations. We expand these over three years: Year 1 develops natural language query interfaces, household-level AI capabilities, and Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers—standardised interfaces enabling AI assistants to access PolicyEngine programmatically; Years 2-3 monitor and integrate with emerging AI surfaces as they become available (e.g., ChatGPT's recently announced external app support (OpenAI, 2025)).

Methods: LLM integration (Claude, GPT-4), MCP development, validation against known costings, expert review, user testing, bias auditing. We track accuracy, trust, and usage patterns (Research Question 1).

Dataset Integration for Enhanced Value

We integrate authoritative datasets including OBR projections (enabling "PolicyEngine vs official forecasts" comparisons), DWP enrollment data (combining simulation with actual take-up patterns), and others from ONS, HMT, and HMRC as needed. This addresses Research Question 2 by measuring how dataset integration affects user confidence and research partnerships.

Methods: Data collection protocols, automated comparison algorithms, discrepancy analysis, public dashboards, API development, historical integration.

WORKSTREAM 2: MODEL ENHANCEMENT AND POLICY RESPONSE

Council Tax Integration

We will add council tax to microsimulation, enabling combined local and national tax burden analysis. This addresses a significant gap—existing models omit local taxation despite £40bn annual revenue.

Methods: Test-driven development (proven with childcare (PolicyEngine, 2024a)): (1) implement council tax bands and local authority rates from MHCLG data (MHCLG, 2024), (2) validation test cases, (3) compare against administrative totals, (4) validate distributional impacts.

Deliverables: Council tax by band and local authority, national model integration, validation report, policy examples.

Budget and Policy Moment Analysis

We will provide rapid-response analysis for critical policy moments: (1) Spring Budget analysis (distributional impacts, household examples, regional breakdowns); (2) Autumn Budget analysis; (3) Election manifesto comparisons; (4) Ad hoc urgent requests. Flexible allocation permits model enhancements if needed.

Methods: 48-hour turnaround protocols, template-based generation, pre-positioned scenarios, weekend capacity. Each Budget requires 1-2 person-weeks intensive work.

Deliverables: 3 Spring Budgets, 3 Autumn Budgets (e.g., PolicyEngine, 2024c), manifestos (e.g., PolicyEngine, 2024b), ad hoc requests, model enhancements (VAT, monthly data) as needed.

WORKSTREAM 3: RESEARCH PARTNERSHIPS AND COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT

Local Media and Parliamentary Outreach

We will develop constituency-specific features and coordinate targeted engagement: enhanced web views showing "Your Constituency at a Glance," automated local reports, roundtables with regional press, workshops with parliamentary staff.

Methods: UI/UX enhancements (Citizen Codex design agency), report templates, roundtable/workshop development, partnership coordination.

Expert Engagement and Local Market Development

A dedicated research staff member balances: (1) engaging expert stakeholders for feedback and validation, and (2) establishing effective adoption among local organisations and under-resourced groups new to microsimulation. Target: 75+ external citations over three years through research partnerships.

Methods: Targeted expert roundtables, research partnership development, regional workshops with local councils, user needs discovery, co-creation with new organisations. Track citations, partnerships, and adoption patterns (Research Question 3).

Annual User Symposia

We will host three annual gatherings: 50-100 PolicyEngine users, case study presentations, methodology discussions, networking.

Methods: London venue arrangement, user presentation curation, expert panels, feedback collection.

Poverty and Child Poverty Dashboard

We will develop a public dashboard with real-time poverty metrics and policy scenario comparisons, focusing on child poverty given policy salience.

Methods: Dashboard development (Plotly), microsimulation integration, scenario comparison, public deployment.

Civil Society Workshops and Academic Dissemination

We will deliver specialised NGO/charity workshops, 9-12 conference presentations over three years, and implement a professional CRM for user segment tracking.

Methods: Workshop development/delivery, conference papers, CRM implementation with segmentation.

QUALITY ASSURANCE AND EVALUATION

All workstreams employ test-driven development, expert review, beta testing, and transparent external validation. We track adoption metrics, usage during policy moments, and evidence quality in debates.
