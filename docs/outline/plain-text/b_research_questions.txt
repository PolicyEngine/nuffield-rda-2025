This three-year project addresses interconnected research questions about using microsimulation to inform policy decisions:
How can AI enable broader use of microsimulation evidence for policy decisions through evolving interfaces while maintaining accuracy and trust?

Building on our current grant's natural language microsimulation insights, we will develop household-level AI capabilities, Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers for AI assistant integration, and explore emerging platforms. Tracking comprehension, accuracy, and trust across interfaces over three years establishes best practices for AI-enabled policy analysis.
How does integrating authoritative datasets enhance microsimulation's capacity to inform policy on critical issues?

We will assess how integrated OBR projections (enabling validation against official forecasts) and DWP enrollment data (combining simulation with actual programme participation) improve the model's ability to address policy questions around child poverty, benefit reform, and fiscal sustainabilityâ€”issues central to current UK policy debates.
What outreach strategies maximise adoption among both expert stakeholders and under-resourced local organisations?

Through a dedicated research staff member partnering on research questions, targeted roundtables, and constituency-level analysis, we will identify effective approaches for engaging expert feedback while establishing effective adoption at the local level.
