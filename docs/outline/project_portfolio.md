- **Q2:** AI authoring tool development, first symposium
- **Q3:** OBR integration, poverty dashboard v1
- **Q4:** Year 1 evaluation, policy buffer deployment

### Year 2 (Months 13-24)
- **Q1:** Enhanced features, expanded training program
- **Q2:** Second symposium, hackathon event
- **Q3:** Final deliverables, impact measurement
- **Q4:** Project wrap-up, sustainability planning

## Exploratory / Future Work (Not in Â£300-350k scope)

These could be follow-on projects or pursued with other funding:

- **Panel Data Microsimulation** - Need to define specific policy question first
- **OLG General Equilibrium** (Â£100k) - Would need major additional funding
- **Mobile App** (Â£64k) - Lower priority; web-first approach preferred
- **Economic Growth Modeling** - Exploratory; overlap with OBR unclear

## Questions to Resolve

1. **Internal/External Report Targets:** What are realistic numbers for X and Y?
2. **Panel Data:** What specific policy question would justify this investment?
3. **Economic Growth:** Is there a gap that OBR doesn't fill?
4. **VAT Distribution:** Should this be folded into core model work or separate project?

## Next Steps

1. **Select preferred portfolio** (A, B, or C - or customize)
2. **Define research questions** based on selected components
3. **Draft outline application responses** using portfolio as foundation
4. **Create project timeline/Gantt chart**
5. **Develop budget spreadsheet** with detailed line items
