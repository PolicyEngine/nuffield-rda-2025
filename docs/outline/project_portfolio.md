# PolicyEngine Nuffield R&D Fund - Final Project Portfolio

**Total Budget:** £380,000
**Duration:** 36 months (3 years)
**Application Deadline:** October 6, 2025

## Overview

This portfolio represents our final selected project suite for the Nuffield R&D Fund application. Building on successful elite adoption from our previous Nuffield grant (HM Treasury pilot, IFS/Resolution Foundation alignment), this three-year project scales proven capabilities to civil society through AI-powered accessibility, strategic dataset integration, and targeted outreach.

## Project Components by Workstream

### WORKSTREAM 1: AI-POWERED ACCESSIBILITY AND DATA INTEGRATION (£108k, 13 person-months)

#### Multi-Surface AI Integration (£68k, 8.5pm)
**Objective:** Expand AI capabilities across evolving interfaces over three years
- **Year 1:** Production-ready natural language query interfaces, household-level AI capabilities, and Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers
- **Years 2-3:** Monitor and integrate with emerging AI surfaces as they become available (e.g., platforms like ChatGPT's external app support)

**Why:** Builds on current grant's launch of natural language microsimulation insights; positions PolicyEngine where users work

**Deliverables:**
- Natural language query interface with validation against known costings
- MCP servers enabling AI assistant integration
- Platform-specific integrations as they become available

4. **Ad hoc urgent requests:** Capacity for ministerial queries or emerging proposals

**Why:** Proven demand from Treasury/No 10; critical moments when evidence has maximum impact

**Methods:**
- 48-hour turnaround protocols
- Template-based report generation
- Weekend/urgent response capacity
- Each Budget requires 1-2 person-weeks intensive work

**Deliverables:**

**Why:** Capitalises on 650 constituencies of data from previous grant

---

#### Expert Engagement and Local Adoption Development (£53k, 7pm)
**Objective:** Balance expert feedback with establishing local-level adoption

**Led by:** Dedicated research staff member (Vahid Ahmadi)

**Two-tier approach:**
1. **Expert stakeholders:** Targeted roundtables, research partnerships with think tanks/universities
2. **Local organisations:** Regional workshops, co-creation with under-resourced groups new to microsimulation

**Target:** 75+ external citations over three years

**Methods:**
- Targeted roundtables with expert users
- Research partnership development
- Regional workshops with local councils and community organisations
- User needs discovery and co-creation

**Research Question 3:** What outreach strategies maximise adoption among both expert stakeholders and under-resourced local organisations?

---

#### Annual User Symposia (£25k, 2pm)
**Objective:** Community building and knowledge sharing

**Deliverables:**
- 3 annual symposia (one per year)
- 50-100 participants each
- Case study presentations
- Expert panel discussions

**Why:** Proven success from previous grant

---

#### Poverty and Child Poverty Dashboard (£32k, 4pm)
**Objective:** Real-time poverty tracking with policy salience

**Deliverables:**
- Public-facing dashboard with real-time poverty metrics
- Child poverty deep-dive analysis
- Policy scenario comparison interface

**Why:** Child poverty is major government priority; demonstrates real-world impact

---

#### Civil Society Workshops and Academic Dissemination (£50k, 5pm)
**Objective:** Specialised support and academic engagement

**Activities:**
- Specialised workshops for NGOs and charities
- 9-12 conference presentations over three years
- Professional CRM system for user segment tracking

**Methods:**
- Workshop series development and delivery
- Conference papers at major economics conferences
- CRM implementation with user segmentation

## Research Questions

1. **AI Evolution:** How can AI democratise access to elite-grade policy analysis tools through evolving interfaces while maintaining accuracy and trust?

2. **Dataset Value:** How does integrating authoritative datasets (OBR, DWP) enhance the value and trustworthiness of microsimulation tools?

3. **Outreach Strategies:** What outreach approaches maximise adoption among both expert stakeholders and under-resourced local organisations?

## Strategic Rationale

This portfolio capitalises on the exceptional success of our previous Nuffield grant: rather than serving only under-resourced think tanks, we attracted the UK's most powerful policy institutions (HM Treasury, No 10). This validation creates an unprecedented opportunity to democratise elite-grade analysis.

**Key Strategic Elements:**
- **AI as the bridge:** Three-year timeline enables sustained investment in making elite tools accessible
- **Dataset integration:** OBR and DWP data address expert validation needs
- **Dual outreach:** Balance expert feedback with local market development
- **Proven infrastructure:** Builds on constituency-level data already developed
- **Flexibility:** Policy buffer adapts to critical policy moments as they arise

## Alignment with Nuffield Priorities

- **Priority 1 (Prosperity):** Council tax, poverty dashboard, policy buffer
- **Priority 2 (Inclusion):** Local outreach, under-resourced organisations
- **Priority 3 (Technology):** AI democratisation, emerging surfaces
- **Priority 5 (Institutions):** Evidence democratisation, research partnerships

## Excluded Components (Deferred or Out of Scope)

- Monthly LFS Updates (can be added via policy buffer if needed)
- VAT Distribution at household level (can be added via policy buffer if needed)
- Mobile App (web-first approach sufficient)
- Hackathon/Contest (defer to potential follow-on work)
- Notification System (lower priority)
