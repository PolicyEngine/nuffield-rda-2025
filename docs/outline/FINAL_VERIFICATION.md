### ✅ Content Synchronisation System

**Automated Pipeline:**
1. Edit markdown sources (`docs/outline/responses/*.md`, `docs/outline/project_portfolio.md`)
2. Git pre-commit hook auto-runs:
   - `python3 docs/outline/assemble_outline.py` → generates `ASSEMBLED_OUTLINE.md`
   - `python3 scripts/sync_content.py` → generates `site/src/data/*.ts` files
   - `python3 scripts/proofread.py` → verifies UK spelling
3. React site auto-reloads with updated data
4. No manual intervention required

**Files Never Edited Directly:**
- `docs/outline/ASSEMBLED_OUTLINE.md` (generated)
- `site/src/data/outline-responses.ts` (generated)
- `site/src/data/portfolioData.ts` (generated)
