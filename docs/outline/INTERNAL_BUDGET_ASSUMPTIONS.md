**INTERNAL DOCUMENT - NOT FOR SUBMISSION**
This breaks down the budget by implied annual salaries to verify allocations are reasonable.

## Staff Salary Assumptions

### Max Ghenis (PI, 25% FTE)
- Grant allocation: £60,000 over 3 years
- Implied annual salary: £60k / 3yr / 0.25 FTE = **£80,000/year**
- Category: **Staff costs: PI Time**

### Nikhil Woodruff (Co-I, 30% FTE)
- Grant allocation: £58,000 over 3 years
- Implied annual salary: £58k / 3yr / 0.30 FTE = **£64,400/year**
- Category: **Staff costs: Co-I Time**

### Vahid Ahmadi (Research Associate, 75% FTE)
- **Actual salary: £45,000/year**
- Grant allocation: £45k/yr × 0.75 FTE × 3yr = **£101,250**
- Budgeted (rounded): **£101,000**
- Category: **Staff costs: Team Members**
- ✅ Verification: £101k / 3yr / 0.75 FTE = £44.9k/year ≈ £45k

### Anthony Volk (Contractor, 20% FTE)
- Grant allocation: £5,000 over 3 years
- Implied rate: £5k / 3yr / 0.20 FTE = **£8,300/year** ⚠️
- Category: **Staff costs: Consultants**
- ⚠️ **Issue:** This seems very low for 20% FTE contractor work
- **Should consider:** £30k for Anthony (£50k/year rate × 0.20 × 3yr)

## Staff Subtotal: £252,000 (66%)
- PI: £60k
- Co-I: £58k
- Team: £101k
- Consultants: £5k (⚠️ may need to increase)
- Overheads: £28k (11% of staff before overheads)

## Non-Staff Costs: £70,000 (18%)

### Communications and Stakeholder Engagement: £36,000
**Breakdown:**
- 3 annual symposia (venues/catering, 50-100 people): £18,000
  - Year 1: £6k, Year 2: £6k, Year 3: £6k
- Workshops (civil society, local media, parliamentary): £8,000
- Conference travel/registration (9-12 presentations): £10,000
  - £800-1,000 per presentation average

### Equipment: £0
- Building CRM ourselves (staff costs above)
- No hardware purchases needed

### Other Direct Costs: £34,000
**Breakdown:**
- Cloud hosting (Google Cloud Platform): £22,500
  - Current UK portion: ~£7,500/year
  - 3 years × £7,500 = £22,500
- LLM API costs (Claude, GPT-4): £10,000
  - AI features, natural language queries
  - ~£3,300/year average
- Data storage/databases: £1,500
  - Dataset integration infrastructure

## Total: £380,000

## FTE Summary (Total: 1.5 FTE)
- Max (PI): 0.25 FTE
- Nikhil (Co-I): 0.30 FTE
- Vahid (Team): 0.75 FTE
- Anthony (Consultant): 0.20 FTE
- **TOTAL: 1.50 FTE**

## Issues to Resolve

⚠️ **Anthony's consultant budget seems low:**
- Current: £5k (implies £8.3k/year for 20% FTE)
- Realistic: £30k (£50k/year × 0.20 × 3yr)
- **Gap: £25k**

**Options:**
1. Increase Consultants to £30k, reduce Team Members to £76k (but then Vahid underfunded)
2. Accept £5k for minimal Anthony consulting
3. Increase total budget to £405k

## Salary Reasonableness Check

✅ Max £80k/year - Reasonable for CEO
✅ Nikhil £64k/year - Reasonable for CTO
✅ Vahid £45k/year - Reasonable for research associate with M.Sc.
⚠️ Anthony £8k/year (20% FTE) - Seems very low for contractor

**Recommendation:** Allocate Anthony at £30k (£50k/year × 20% × 3yr) if budget allows, or reduce his FTE to 3-5% if keeping £5k allocation.
