# Strategic Narrative for 2025 Nuffield Application

## The Inflection Point

**Previous Grant (2024-2025):** Building comprehensive, accurate, accessible infrastructure
- ✅ Local disaggregation (constituencies & local authorities)
- ✅ Childcare & public services
- ✅ Validation dashboards
- ✅ AI integration pilot
- ✅ Training program launch

**Outcome (End of Year 1):** Elite adoption exceeded expectations
- **HM Treasury pilot** (December 2024) - official algorithmic transparency record
- **No 10 Downing Street** (Nikhil seconded to 10DS - not public yet)
- **Think tank validation** - estimates align with IFS and Resolution Foundation
- **Media coverage** - Times, Guardian, Telegraph
- **All major party manifestos** analyzed

**The Opportunity:** Scale from elite to civil society
- Elite institutions validated the tool
- Infrastructure investments paid off faster than expected
- Now positioned to democratize access at scale
- Technology (especially AI) as the bridge

## Strategic Positioning

### What Nuffield Thought Would Happen
**Small think tanks** without resources would gain access to microsimulation

### What Actually Happened (Better!)
**Most powerful institution** (No 10) adopted PolicyEngine as "most flexible and usable model"

### What This Enables (Grant 2.0)
**Connect elite policy to civil society** through:
1. AI tools making technical analysis accessible to non-experts
2. Local area data enabling at-scale outreach to constituencies
3. Evidence generation platforms (dashboards, rapid response)
4. Community infrastructure (training, events, partnerships)

## Key Strategic Arguments

### 1. Proven Track Record - De-Risk the Investment

**Elite Adoption as Validation:**
- No 10 choosing PolicyEngine signals quality/usability at highest level
- Treasury pilot shows it meets government standards
- IFS/Resolution Foundation alignment proves accuracy
- Not speculative - already delivering impact

**Infrastructure Ready:**
- Previous Nuffield grant built the foundation
- Local disaggregation complete - ready to activate
- AI integration piloted - ready to scale
- Training program tested - ready to expand

### 2. Technology-Enabled Democratization

**The AI Bridge:**
- Elite users can handle technical interfaces
- Civil society needs natural language ("How much would X cost?")
- AI authoring tool = report generation at speed of thought
- Builds on proven pilot from previous grant

**Local Data as Catalyst:**
- 650 constituencies = 650 local stories
- MPs want this ("multiple Members of Parliament expressed interest")
- Local media partnerships possible
- Community organizations can see their area

### 3. Scaling What Works

**Training Program Expansion:**
- Monthly sessions launched - now expand reach
- Add specialized tracks (journalists, advocates, local councils)
- From 20 participants → 50+ per session

**Symposium Continuation:**
- First one successful - now make it annual tradition
- User community building itself
- Knowledge sharing accelerates adoption

**New: Policy Buffer:**
- Budgets happen - be ready (48-hour turnaround)
- Manifestos happen - be ready (comparative analysis)
- Ad-hoc requests from No 10/Treasury - be ready
- This IS the scaling moment

### 4. Unique Positioning

**Only tool that:**
- Elite institutions trust (No 10, Treasury)
- Open-source transparency (GitHub, UN Digital Public Good)
- Real-time accessibility (web interface, minutes not weeks)
- Local granularity (constituency-level)
- AI-enabled (natural language queries)

**This combination** = bridge between elite policy and democratic engagement

## Research Questions That Emerge

### Primary Research Questions:

1. **"How can AI democratize access to elite-grade policy analysis tools while maintaining accuracy and trust?"**
   - Addresses Priority 3 (Technology benefiting people)
   - Builds on proven AI pilot
   - Novel: bridging elite adoption and democratic access

2. **"What is the impact of providing local policymakers and civil society organizations with constituency-level microsimulation capabilities?"**
   - Addresses Priority 5 (Trustworthy institutions)
   - Capitalizes on local area investment
   - Novel: at-scale local policy analysis

3. **"Can rapid-response evidence provision improve the quality and inclusivity of policy debates during critical moments (Budgets, elections)?"**
   - Addresses Priority 1 (Prosperous and fair society)
   - Addresses Priority 5 (Effective institutions)
   - Proven demand from No 10/Treasury

### Secondary Research Questions:

4. "What are the distributional impacts of local and national tax interactions (council tax + national reforms)?"
   - Addresses Priority 1
   - Natural extension of local disaggregation

5. "How do different stakeholder groups (media, advocates, local councils) utilize microsimulation tools differently, and what support maximizes impact?"
   - Addresses Priority 2 (Inclusive society)
   - Evidence-based community building

## Resourcing Reality Check

### Estimates That Seem RIGHT:

✅ **Council Tax (£32k, 4pm)** - Reasonable
- Proven track record with similar complexity (childcare)
- Clear validation path (MHCLG data)
- Well-scoped

✅ **Policy Buffer (£40k, 5pm)** - Actually UNDERESTIMATED
- This is where the value is
- Should be £50-60k to ensure quality
- Consider: 48-hour Budget turnaround = weekend work = premium
- **Flexibility:** Buffer includes capacity for model enhancements (VAT improvements, monthly data) if situations warrant
- Covers Spring Budget (March), Autumn Budget (October/November), manifestos, ad-hoc requests
- Recommend: £50k (5pm + £10k rapid response reserve)

✅ **AI Authoring (£48k, 6pm)** - Reasonable
- Building on proven pilot
- LLM costs are real but manageable
- Could add £5k for API costs (Claude/GPT-4)

✅ **Monthly Trainings (£32k, 4pm)** - Slightly underestimated
- 24 sessions over 2 years
- Should include materials development
- Maybe £35-40k to account for specialized tracks

✅ **Symposium (£25k)** - Good breakdown
- £8k staff + £17k venue/travel realistic
- Could go to £30k for larger venue if scaling

✅ **Poverty Dashboard (£32k, 4pm)** - Reasonable
- But this is HIGH impact
- Real-time child poverty tracking = political relevance
- Well-scoped

### Estimates That Need ADJUSTMENT:

⚠️ **VAT Distribution (£8k, 1pm)** - UNDERESTIMATED
- Household-level VAT is complex
- Need to integrate with consumption data properly
- Should be £15-20k, 2-3pm
- OR fold into council tax as "comprehensive household taxation"

⚠️ **Monthly LFS Updates (£32k, 4pm)** - UNDERESTIMATED
- This is infrastructure work (automation, pipelines)
- Nowcasting methodology is research-grade
- Should be £40-50k, 5-6pm
- BUT: May not be necessary if local areas already done?

⚠️ **OBR/HMT Integration (£24k, 3pm)** - Slightly underestimated
- Validation dashboards are valuable
- Should be £28-30k to ensure quality
- This builds credibility for civil society users

⚠️ **CRM (£16k)** - UNDERESTIMATED
- CRM setup is always more complex than expected
- User segmentation, integration, training
- Should be £20-25k (£10k implementation, £12k licenses + setup)

### Estimates That Are OPTIMISTIC but Acceptable:

⚠️ **Hackathon (£20k)** - Tight but doable
- £10k prizes is modest (top prize £5k?)
- Could be £25-30k for better prizes and promotion
- BUT: Community-building value is high

⚠️ **Conferences (£30k)** - Reasonable if strategic
- £3k per international conference x 6 = £18k travel
- £12k staff time (1.5pm)
- But: Pick conferences strategically (IFS, RES, BIEN, etc.)

## Narrative Arc for Application

### Previous Grant Achievement (2024-2025):
"Built comprehensive UK microsimulation infrastructure trusted by elite institutions"

### Unexpected Success:
"HM Treasury pilot (Dec 2024) and No 10 adoption proved quality and usability at highest level"

### The Opportunity (This Grant):
"Scale proven tools from elite institutions to civil society, enabled by AI and local data"

### Three-Part Strategy:

**1. Technology-Enabled Access (App)**
- AI authoring tools bridge expert/non-expert divide
- OBR/HMT integration builds trust
- Parliamentary toolkit serves elected representatives

**2. Evidence Infrastructure (Model)**
- Council tax completes household burden picture
- Policy buffer enables rapid response when it matters
- Poverty dashboard provides real-time tracking

**3. Community Scaling (Growth)**
- Training expansion reaches new audiences (NGOs, media, councils)
- Local media partnerships multiply reach
- Free tool adoption support for civil society
- Symposium/conferences build ecosystem
- **Strict neutrality:** Enable analysis of any policy by any stakeholder

### Impact Thesis:

"If No 10 Downing Street finds PolicyEngine flexible and usable enough to integrate into government workflows, and if Resolution Foundation and IFS are expected to adopt it to 'minimize surprises,' then with appropriate democratization tools (AI, training, partnerships), civil society organizations, local media, and citizens can equally benefit from elite-grade policy analysis."

## Word Choices for Application

**Frame as:**
- ✅ "Scaling proven infrastructure"
- ✅ "From elite validation to democratic access"
- ✅ "Technology-enabled evidence democratization"
- ✅ "Capitalizing on unexpected elite adoption"

**Avoid:**
- ❌ "Building new capabilities" (that was last grant)
- ❌ "Experimental" (No 10 de-risked it)
- ❌ "Pilot" (beyond pilot phase)

## Evidence Points to Emphasize

### Government Validation:
- HM Treasury [official algorithmic transparency record](https://www.gov.uk/algorithmic-transparency-records/hmt-modelling-policy-engine)
- Times: "expected to be used mostly in budget periods"
- Guardian coverage of government AI adoption

### Technical Quality:
- Estimates align with IFS and Resolution Foundation
- 2.6% deviation from OBR on Universal Credit
- First to use synthetic firm microdata for VAT

### Reach Momentum:
- All major party manifestos analyzed (2024 election)
- Monthly training sessions launched (fall 2024)
- Public event at Central Hall Westminster (Nov 2025)
- Parliamentary constituency-level analysis ready

### Innovation:
- AI-powered explanations (unique in UK microsimulation)
- Real-time web interface (minutes vs weeks)
- Open-source transparency (UN Digital Public Good)

## Budget Realism Assessment

### Staff Time Assumptions
**Current blended rate: £8k/month seems REASONABLE but might be conservative**

**Reality check:**
- Max (PI): £10-12k/month actual cost?
- Nikhil (Co-I): £8-10k/month
- Research associate: £6-7k/month
- Contractors: £6-8k/month
- Blended average: £8k is defensible

**But consider:**
- No 10 secondment means Nikhil's time is more constrained
- May need to reduce Nikhil FTE or increase other staff
- Could justify higher rates given elite-level work

### Non-Staff Cost Realism

**Event Costs:**
- ✅ Symposium venue (£6k) - realistic for London venue, 50-100 people
- ✅ Conference travel (£3k) - realistic for Europe/US conferences
- ⚠️ Could argue for £4-5k per conference (registration + accommodation rising)

**Software/Systems:**
- ⚠️ CRM licenses (£4k/year) - HubSpot/Salesforce more like £6-8k/year
- Consider: £10k/year for enterprise CRM
- ✅ API costs for AI - should explicitly budget £5k

**Prizes/Incentives:**
- ⚠️ Hackathon prizes (£5k top) - could be £10k top + £3k + £2k = £15k total
- More competitive prizes = better quality

### Overall Budget Philosophy

**Current approach: Conservative (good for approval)**
- Leaves room for adjustments
- Easy to justify
- Under typical award (£300k)

**Alternative: Ambitious (shows vision)**
- Push toward £350k
- Add high-value components
- Demonstrate scale thinking

**Recommendation: BALANCED (£340k)**
- Slightly above typical but well justified
- Includes new high-value components
- Shows ambition + realism

## Missing Components to Consider

### 1. Real-Time Policy Outcome Tracking
**Why:** Build trust through transparency
**What:** Track actual vs projected impacts of implemented policies
**Cost:** £30k (4pm)
**Status:** Consider for Full Application if invited

### 2. Local Council Partnership Program
**Why:** Local authorities are underserved by policy analysis
**What:** Training, toolkits, co-creation with councils
**Cost:** £25k (3pm)
**Status:** Strong addition if budget allows

### 3. Automated Impact Assessment Generator
**Why:** No 10 wants consistency, speed
**What:** One-click "standard impact assessment" for any reform
**Cost:** £35k (4pm + templates)
**Status:** High value but may be covered by AI authoring

### 4. Policy Learning from International Comparisons
**Why:** You have US, Canada, UK models
**What:** "What if UK adopted X policy from Canada?"
**Cost:** £20k (2pm)
**Status:** Interesting but not core to scaling story

## Recommended Actions

- Enhanced contingency: £5k

**Ambitious Total: £349k** (well within £500k max, justified by proven elite adoption)

## Strategic Improvements to Materials

### Update project_components.yaml:
1. Add new components (local media, parliamentary, civil society)
2. Adjust costs based on realism review
3. Reorganize around App/Model/Growth clearly
4. Add "builds on previous grant investment" tags

### Update portfolio visualization:
1. Remove fixed portfolios
2. Show menu of options with recommended tier
3. Highlight "scaling story" components
4. Show cumulative total as components selected

### Key Messages for Narrative:

**For Summary (100 words):**
"Following successful elite adoption (HM Treasury pilot, No 10 integration), PolicyEngine seeks to democratize access to the same tools used by government. Building on Nuffield-funded infrastructure (local disaggregation, AI pilot, training program), this project scales proven capabilities to civil society through AI-powered interfaces, local media partnerships, and expanded community engagement."

**For Case for Importance (200 words):**
Focus on: Elite validation → scaling opportunity → technology as bridge → timing (Budgets, manifestos) → unique positioning

**For Methods (750 words):**
Three workstreams:
1. AI & Accessibility (builds on pilot)
2. Local Scaling (capitalizes on constituencies)
3. Evidence Infrastructure (serves policy moments)

## Questions for Max

1. **Policy Buffer:** Is £50k (vs £40k) justified for rapid response quality?
2. **Nikhil's availability:** Does No 10 secondment reduce his FTE? Need to adjust budget?
3. **Local media:** Is £20k enough for meaningful partnerships? Or should it be £30k?
4. **Target total:** Comfortable pushing to £340-360k vs staying under £325k?
5. **Civil society partnerships:** Is this worth adding or too scattered?
6. **Timing:** When does No 10 work become public? Affects how we position it.

## Next Steps

1. Update project_components.yaml with new components and adjusted costs
2. Rebuild Portfolio page as interactive component selector (not 3 fixed options)
3. Draft research questions based on scaling narrative
4. Update project_portfolio.md with strategic narrative
5. Create draft responses to outline questions A-H
