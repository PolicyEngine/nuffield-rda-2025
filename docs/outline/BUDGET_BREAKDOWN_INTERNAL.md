## Assessment

**Overall:** Budget is reasonable but Vahid's implied £34k/year salary is low.

**Options:**
1. **Accept as-is:** £34k/year for 75% FTE research associate (tight but defensible)
2. **Increase Team Members by £14k** (to £90k total): Makes Vahid £40k/year (more typical)
   - Reduce Consultants or increase total budget
3. **Reduce Vahid to 65% FTE:** Makes implied salary £39k/year with same £76k budget

**Recommendation:** Option 3 - Reduce Vahid to 65% FTE
- Vahid: £76k / 3yr / 0.65 = £39k/year (reasonable)
- Total FTE: 25% + 30% + 65% + 20% = 1.4 FTE
- Leaves more budget for other costs

**Current Team FTE:** 1.5 FTE (25% + 30% + 75% + 20%)
**Proposed Team FTE:** 1.4 FTE (25% + 30% + 65% + 20%)
