## 🎯 Strategic Positioning

### The Story:
**Previous Grant:** Build infrastructure → **Elite Adoption** (Treasury, No 10) → **This Grant:** Scale to civil society

### Key Messages:
1. **De-risked:** Elite validation proves quality
2. **Infrastructure ready:** Local areas, AI pilot, validation built
3. **Timely:** Budget cycles = natural experiments
4. **Unique:** Only tool with elite trust + open access + AI + local granularity

### Research Questions:
1. Can AI democratize elite-grade tools while maintaining trust?
2. What's the impact of constituency-level microsimulation?
3. Does rapid-response evidence improve policy debates?

## 💰 Budget Breakdown (£324k)

### Staff Costs (£287,800 = 89%)
- PI Time (Max, 40% FTE): £76,800
- Co-I Time (Nikhil, 50% FTE): £96,000
- Team Members (RA + contractors): £75,000
- Consultants: £12,000
- Overheads (30%): £28,000

### Non-Staff Costs (£36,200 = 11%)
- Communications (symposia, conferences, travel): £55,200
- Equipment (CRM licenses): £14,000
- Other direct costs: £21,000

**Note:** Nikhil FTE reduced to 50% (from 70% in previous grant) due to other commitments

## 🔄 Key Changes Made

### Strategic Corrections:
- ❌ Removed "API access" language (tools are FREE)
- ❌ Removed "campaign" language (strict neutrality)
- ✅ Changed to "External Citations Program" (output vs input focus)
- ✅ Policy Buffer explicitly covers Spring/Autumn Budgets with flexible scope

### Cost Adjustments (evidence-based):
- Policy Buffer: £40k → £50k (rapid response premium)
- AI Authoring: £48k → £53k (LLM API costs)
- External Citations: £32k → £40k (hybrid + travel)
- OBR Integration: £24k → £28k (quality buffer)
- CRM: £16k → £24k (enterprise realistic)

### New Strategic Components:
1. **Local Media Training (£20k)** - USE the 650 constituencies!
2. **Parliamentary Toolkit (£15k)** - MPs already asking
3. **Civil Society Training (£20k)** - FREE tool adoption support

### Deferred Components:
- Monthly LFS Updates - can add via policy buffer if needed
- VAT Distribution - can add via policy buffer if needed
- Mobile App - web-first priority
- Hackathon - better for Year 2

## 📋 To Do Before Submission

### Refinement:
- [ ] Review word counts (currently 83% - room to add examples/evidence)
- [ ] Verify all references are cited in text
- [ ] Check Nikhil's actual FTE availability
- [ ] Confirm advisory board members
- [ ] Add any recent UK usage examples (check policyengine-app blog)

### Budget Details:
- [ ] Finalize PI/Co-I salary calculations
- [ ] Confirm overhead rate with institution
- [ ] Verify CRM costs (HubSpot vs Salesforce quotes)
- [ ] Double-check event venue costs for London

### Strategic Decisions:
- [ ] Comfortable with £324k total? (vs £300k conservative or £350k ambitious)
- [ ] When can No 10 work be mentioned publicly?
- [ ] Should we mention Resolution Foundation/IFS alignment goal?
- [ ] Target: 50 external citations realistic over 24 months?

## 💡 Strategic Insights from Review

### What Makes This Strong:

1. **Elite validation de-risks the investment**
   - Treasury pilot proves quality
   - No 10 adoption proves usability
   - IFS/RF alignment proves accuracy

2. **Infrastructure already built** (previous grant succeeded)
   - 650 constituencies ready to activate
   - AI pilot ready to scale
   - Validation dashboards ready to expand

3. **Timing is perfect**
   - Budgets create natural experiments
   - Election cycles drive demand
   - No 10 wants RF/IFS to adopt (reduce surprises)

4. **Scaling story is compelling**
   - Not "build new capabilities" (did that)
   - Not "pilot" (beyond that)
   - IS "scale proven tools from elite to democratic"

5. **AI as the bridge**
   - Elite users can handle technical interfaces
   - Civil society needs natural language
   - AI authoring = democratization technology

6. **Local data as multiplier**
   - 650 constituencies = 650 local stories
   - Local media partnerships = 10x reach
   - MPs want this = direct policy influence

### Resourcing Realism:

**Well-scoped:**
- Council Tax (£32k, 4pm) - proven with childcare
- Symposium (£25k) - realistic for London
- Poverty Dashboard (£32k) - clear deliverable

**Appropriately increased:**
- Policy Buffer (£50k) - rapid response premium justified
- AI Authoring (£53k) - API costs real
- CRM (£24k) - enterprise is complex

**Smart new additions:**
- Local Media (£20k) - capitalizes on existing data
- Parliamentary (£15k) - lightweight, high ROI
- External Citations (£40k) - output-focused

### What's Different from Previous Grant:

**Then (2024-2025): Build**
- Add programs (childcare, public services)
- Create local areas (constituencies)
- Pilot AI integration
- Launch training program

**Now (2025-2027): Scale**
- Use AI to democratize access
- Activate local areas (media, MPs)
- Target measurable adoption (50+ citations)
- Rapid response to policy moments

## ✨ The Pitch in One Sentence

"If No 10 Downing Street trusts PolicyEngine enough to integrate it into government workflows, then with AI democratization tools and targeted support, civil society can benefit from the same elite-grade policy analysis."
