# Strategic Review - Executive Summary

**Date:** October 9, 2025
**Review Scope:** Portfolio components, budget realism, strategic positioning

## 🎯 Key Strategic Insight

**Previous Grant Expectation:** Small think tanks would gain access
**Actual Outcome:** Elite institutions adopted it (No 10, HM Treasury)
**New Opportunity:** Scale elite-validated tools to civil society

**This is a BETTER story** - you've de-risked the investment and proven quality at the highest level.

## ✅ Recommended Portfolio: £324k over 24 months

### Model Enhancement (£82k)
- **Council Tax:** £32k - Well-scoped, proven track record
- **Policy Response Buffer:** £50k ⬆️ (was £40k)
  - **Key point:** Flexible scope covers Spring/Autumn Budgets, manifestos
  - Can include VAT enhancements or monthly LFS data if situations warrant
  - 48-hour turnaround requires premium resourcing
  - **This is where the scaling value is** - rapid response to policy moments

### App Development (£110k)
- **AI Report Authoring:** £53k ⬆️ (was £48k)
  - Add £5k for LLM API costs (Claude/GPT-4)
  - Builds on proven pilot from previous grant
  - **The bridge from elite to democratic access**

- **OBR/HMT Integration:** £28k ⬆️ (was £24k)
  - Quality buffer for validation dashboards
  - Builds credibility for all users

- **Local Media Training Program:** £20k 🆕
  - **Capitalize on 650 constituencies** from previous grant
  - Train local journalists on FREE tools (web app + Python)
  - Reusable templates for local impact stories
  - **Multiplies reach 10x+**

- **Parliamentary Constituency Toolkit:** £15k 🆕
  - MPs already requesting this
  - Enhance web app for constituency views
  - Training for parliamentary researchers
  - **650 MPs = 650 potential champions**

### Growth & Engagement (£132k)
- **External Citations Program:** £40k 🆕 (replaces monthly trainings)
  - **Target: 50+ external citations/reports over 24 months**
  - Flexible engagement: hybrid trainings, regional visits, smaller events
  - Output-focused (usage) vs input-focused (fixed schedule)
  - If product is good (with AI), adoption scales naturally

- **Annual Symposium:** £25k
  - £8k staff + £17k venue/catering/travel
  - Well-scoped

- **Poverty Dashboard:** £32k
  - HIGH political relevance (child poverty)
  - Real-time tracking

- **Conference Program:** £30k
  - £12k staff + £18k travel
  - 6-8 strategic presentations over 2 years

- **CRM System:** £24k ⬆️ (was £16k)
  - £10k implementation + £14k licenses (£7k/year)
  - Enterprise CRM is always more complex

- **Civil Society Training Program:** £20k 🆕
  - Workshops for NGOs/charities on FREE tools
  - Python notebook templates
  - Web app workflow documentation
  - **Completes democratization story**

## 🔴 Components DEFERRED (Not in £324k)

**Can be added via Policy Buffer if needed:**
- Monthly LFS Updates (£32k) - Add if Budget requires real-time data
- VAT Distribution household-level (£8k) - Add if distributional VAT analysis needed
- Mobile App (£64k) - Web-first priority
- Hackathon (£20k) - Year 2 when community larger
- OLG Modeling (£100k) - Too ambitious for this scope

## 💰 Budget Corrections Made

**Increases (evidence-based):**
- Policy Buffer: +£10k (rapid response premium)
- AI Authoring: +£5k (LLM API costs)
- Monthly Trainings: +£8k (specialized tracks)
- OBR Integration: +£4k (quality buffer)
- CRM: +£8k (enterprise realistic)

**New Components (strategic):**
- Local Media Training: +£20k (USE the local data!)
- Parliamentary Toolkit: +£15k (MPs want this!)
- Civil Society Training: +£20k (democratization)

**Removed from budget:**
- "Civil Society API Partnership" - ❌ REMOVED
  - PolicyEngine tools are FREE, not paid API
  - Changed to training/support program

## 🚫 Language Corrections

**Fixed "campaign" language:**
- ❌ "Pre-built templates for common campaigns"
- ✅ "Pre-built templates for policy analysis"
- **Reason:** Must maintain strict neutrality - analyze ANY policy, don't advocate

**Fixed API confusion:**
- ❌ "API access for verified NGOs"
- ✅ "Training on free Python package and web app"
- **Reason:** Python API and web app are free; only US benefit-access REST API is paid

## 📊 Resourcing Realism Assessment

### Underestimated (now fixed):
- Policy Buffer: 48-hour Budget turnarounds = weekend work
- CRM: Enterprise systems always complex
- Trainings: Specialized tracks need development

### Well-scoped:
- Council Tax: Proven with childcare precedent
- Symposium: £6k venue + £11k other realistic
- Poverty Dashboard: Clear scope, high impact

### Smart deferrals:
- Monthly LFS: Expensive, can add via buffer if urgent
- VAT household: Incremental, can enhance via buffer
- Hackathon: Better when community is larger

## 🎯 Strategic Framing for Application

### Narrative Arc:
1. **Previous grant:** Built infrastructure (local areas, AI pilot, training)
2. **Unexpected outcome:** Elite adoption (Treasury, No 10) validated quality
3. **This grant:** Scale proven infrastructure to civil society
4. **Mechanism:** AI + local data + training = democratization

### Research Questions (draft):

**Primary:**
1. "How can AI democratize elite-grade policy analysis while maintaining accuracy and trust?"
   - Priority 3 (Technology benefiting people)
   - Builds on proven pilot

2. "What is the impact of providing local policymakers with constituency-level microsimulation?"
   - Priority 5 (Trustworthy institutions)
   - Capitalizes on local area data

3. "Can rapid-response evidence improve policy debates during critical moments (Budgets, elections)?"
   - Priority 1 (Prosperous society) + Priority 5 (Effective institutions)
   - Proven demand from No 10

### Key Messages:

**Frame as:**
- ✅ "Scaling proven infrastructure"
- ✅ "From elite validation to democratic access"
- ✅ "Technology-enabled democratization"

**Avoid:**
- ❌ "Building capabilities" (done in previous grant)
- ❌ "Experimental" (No 10 proved it works)
- ❌ "Campaign support" (must stay neutral)

## 📈 Evidence to Highlight

**Elite Validation (De-risks investment):**
- HM Treasury official algorithmic transparency record
- No 10 integration (when public - "most flexible and usable model")
- IFS/Resolution Foundation estimate alignment
- Times/Guardian media coverage

**Technical Quality:**
- 2.6% deviation from OBR (Universal Credit)
- First synthetic firm microdata for UK VAT
- Real-time web interface (minutes vs weeks for traditional models)

**Scaling Momentum:**
- All major party manifestos analyzed (2024 election)
- Monthly trainings launched (fall 2024)
- Central Hall Westminster event (November 2025)
- Constituency-level analysis ready (650 constituencies)

## ❓ Questions for Max

1. **Budget target:** Comfortable with £324k? Or prefer conservative £300k / ambitious £349k?

2. **Nikhil's FTE:** Does No 10 secondment reduce his availability? Need to adjust Co-I time in budget?

3. **No 10 timing:** When can we reference publicly? Affects application framing (might need to be vaguer)

4. **New components priority:**
   - Local Media Training (£20k) - Essential or nice-to-have?
   - Parliamentary Toolkit (£15k) - High ROI or defer?
   - Civil Society Training (£20k) - Core or optional?

5. **Policy Buffer scope:** Is £50k enough for 2 Spring + 2 Autumn Budgets + manifestos + flexibility?

6. **Civil society focus:** Should we emphasize NGO/charity adoption more, or focus on media/MPs?

## 🚀 Next Steps

Once portfolio is finalized:

1. **Update project_components.yaml** with corrected costs and new components
2. **Update Portfolio page** in React app with revised components
3. **Draft outline responses** (A-H) using strategic narrative
4. **Create detailed budget** allocating £324k across Nuffield categories
5. **Develop research questions** based on chosen portfolio

**Timeline:** Outline due October 6, 2025 (should start drafting responses soon!)
